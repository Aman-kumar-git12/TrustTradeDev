🚀 TrustTrade — Business Buying & Selling Platform

A full-stack B2B & B2C marketplace where sellers list their businesses and digital assets, and buyers can discover, negotiate, and close deals in real time through a secure and transparent system.

This platform is built to solve the problem of unstructured, unsafe, and untracked business transactions that exist on traditional listing websites.

🧩 Problem Statement

Most existing marketplaces like OLX or Facebook groups only allow:
- Posting listings
- Random buyer messages
- No negotiation tracking
- No business analytics
- No trust system

This causes:
- Fake buyers
- No deal closure tracking
- No seller performance metrics
- Poor user experience
- No platform built for real business transactions


💡 Solution

TrustTrade provides a complete transaction ecosystem for business selling:
- Sellers can create and manage businesses
- Buyers can browse, filter, and contact sellers
- Real-time negotiation chat
- Seller performance dashboards
- Secure authentication
- Structured deal flow

It works like:
Shopify + OLX + WhatsApp for business trading


⭐ Extras for Buyers

TrustTrade allows buyers to build a credibility-based profile that improves with real activity. As buyers participate in negotiations, respond quickly, and complete deals, their profile upgrades and their Elite Score increases.

A higher Elite Score unlocks discounts and premium access. These discounts never reduce seller earnings — TrustTrade covers them internally so sellers always receive full value.

Buyers also earn trust badges such as Verified Buyer, High Completion, and Elite Trader, allowing sellers to instantly identify serious buyers and avoid time-wasters.


🏢 Extras for Sellers

TrustTrade provides sellers with a powerful, interactive dashboard that gives full visibility into their business.

Sellers can analyze:
- Overall business performance
- Individual products or assets
- Customer and buyer behavior

These insights show buyer interest, negotiation activity, product performance, and listing health, helping sellers price better and close deals faster with high-confidence buyers.
