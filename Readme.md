# Follow this steps to run this project 

> ⚠️ **Note:** The backend is hosted on Render (free tier), so the first request may take **30–40 seconds** due to cold start.
>
> If the page does not load:
> 1. Refresh the page once.
> 2. If it still doesn’t load, **close the tab and reopen the link**.
> 3. Repeat this 2–3 times if needed.
>
> This happens because the server wakes up on the first request. Please be patient.

- Local state handled using React hooks.

## Key Hooks Used
- `useState` — component state
- `useEffect` — lifecycle & data fetching
- `useContext` — global state access
- `useRef` — DOM interactions
- `useMemo` / `useCallback` — performance optimization

## UI & Styling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

- Role-based access control (Buyer / Seller)
- Business, asset, and negotiation management
- Secure payment verification
- Invoice generation (Buyer & Seller)
